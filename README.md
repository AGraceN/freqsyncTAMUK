Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Frequency Control

This project is a simulation of a Machine Learning Predictive process utilizing a Guasian Noise Stochastic Component and ULLT to predict the frequency output of a grid generation source at a point in time that will correspond with the corrective control input. The result of the predicted frequency is sent to an Artificial Intelligence process, Adaline, to produce an optimized corrective frequency to be sent to multiple generation sources. The optimized control signals will result in reduced frequency deviation from the specified standard of 60.00Hz for the North American Grid and reduced total frequency differential between generation sources. The simulation will also contain a simulation of the current manual process, including the go low frequency control target, and compare the results to determine the viability of this control method for future research and integration into the public power grid.
